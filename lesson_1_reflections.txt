How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The bug was caused due to a change in the file and the diff highlighted the changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can see the effects of certain changes on certain functionalities.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It will only happen when reaching a logical milestone.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Documents usually are stand-alone, while code is generally comprised of multiple files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    log shows static states and diff shows progressions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I know i can always take them back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Developing code
