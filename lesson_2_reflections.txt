What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    So the folder will contain all it's history and be Git-aware.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    It buffers between them. It is not commited yet to anything.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    I can only add the relevant files to the staging area before performing the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    When I want to advance in several parallel directions.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    I can see where the branches occured and the relationships between them.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

    It contains the united version of all changes that were made in both branches seperately.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

    Pros: Saves time.
    Cons: May introduce new bugs by making wrong commits.
