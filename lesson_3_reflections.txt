When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I want to share my work and collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I wan't the updates to occur at meaningful timepoints, rather than just randomally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A fork takes a GitHub repository and generates another DIFFERENT GitHub repository from it.
    A clone takes a local/remote repository and makes a copy of it locally.
    Branch occurs inside the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    I can work offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without github i'll have to sent URLs manually.
    Without git, I wont be able to work offline.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I'm not sure whether the change is going to break the master.
    When the change may be experimental.
    Adding directly to master, is cleaner and faster.
    Working with a branch is safer and less error-prone.
